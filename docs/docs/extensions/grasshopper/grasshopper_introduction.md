# Introduction

The IDEA StatiCa Grasshopper plugin consists of the following primary parts: 

![Component overview](images/grasshopper_iom_api_components.png)



1. [Components to generate IDEA Open Model (IOM)](grasshopper_iom_components_overview.md). These are used to facilitate:

    * Create, Import or Modify IDEA Open Model.
    * Custom FEA Conversions
    * Geometric conversion: IOM <-> Rhino
    * Explicit modelling of members, plates, bolts, cuts, and welds.

2.	[Components to interact with IDEA Design Applications](grasshopper_connection_app_components.md). The are used to:

    * Create, import, modify design app files, such as connections.
    * Get and update geometry and components.
    * Apply user defined templates.
    * Get and update user defined parameters.
    * Run calculation and extract results.
    * Get further design information (inc. fabrication costs etc.)

Components to generate IOM are API agnostic, and therefore do not require a license of IDEA StatiCa.  

Component that interacts with IDEA StatiCa Design Appâ€™s require an active license of IDEA StatiCa. 
Open Model components are used across Design App components in cases where geometry conversion and interoperability are concerned.
