Documentation of IDEA StatiCA API
## Idea Open Model
This model contains information about geometry, materials and loading of a structure. It is used for exchanging data with IdeaStatica and any othe FE or CAD application  [Latest version (v21.0)](https://idea-statica.github.io/iom/iom-api/latest/index.html)

## IdeaStatiCa.Plugin
is the gateway to IDEA StatiCa. It includes classes which allows communication and controlling IDEA StatiCa applications. It also includes classes which provides IDEA StatiCa services to other applications. [Latest version (v21.0)](https://github.com/idea-statica/ideastatica-plugin)
