## Example _calculate-hss.py_

The example shows how to open an project modify values in the setup (in this case hss_limit_plastic_strain (the value of platic strain for high strength steel)) and recalculate the project.


Here is the step-by-step pseudocode:

* Activate the virtual environment.
* Install the requirements from requirements.txt
* run Python script

And the corresponding commands:

```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
py calculate-hss.py
```
