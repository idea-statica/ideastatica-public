## .Net Example Solutions

Each example solution has two debug configurations 'Debug' and 'Debug_NuGet'. Projects in the IdeaStatiCa-SDK-Examples.sln are generally set to Debug_Nuget which means they referencee avaliable Nuget packages on build. As we still actively develop some of the examples avaliable against our source code we use 'Debug' for internal.

## Python Examples

Python examples should be contained in a folder with everything you need to open and run a particular example. Python examples are not provided in the visual studio solution.

## API Examples
