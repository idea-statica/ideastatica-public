# Reiforced cross-section optimization example - rcs-optim-ex.ipynb

This example takes and existing RCS project and performs calculations for a number of different cross-sections under the same loading conditions.

We can use this type of analysis to understand how changing reinforcement can effect the different analysis output criteria that we are designin for to help us choose a more efficient design.

# Calculation of crack width example - crack-width-ex.ipynb

In this examples a capacity of a reinforced cross-section is calculated.
Loading is increases up to 100% of its capacity and crack width is calculated at each step. 

## Requirements 

This example uses a jupyterlab notebook.
